                    My name is Victor Guillen and I'm the owner of this Astrophography website.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I started with this hobby around 5 years ago, when I was looking at stunning pictures from deep space taken by NASA's Hubble Telescope and many others astrophotographers and amateur astronomers around the world.

                    This is a very exciting hobby that can easily move you from success to frustration and back to success. It requires patience and perseverance.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I work as Software developer for a technology company, with many years of experience developing a diverse pool of applications and databases. One of my interests it is Cybersecurity due to the high demand it has in our technology-bound lives.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    I am also a watch collector; I love watches regardless of their price, brand and complications, I just love them and that's another of my hobbies.
                </p>
