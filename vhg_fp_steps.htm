                <p>
                    This is the outline of the process and the necessary steps to follow in order to get close to the goal of obtaining awesome pictures of celestial objects. Please remember that these
                    are guidelines and you must always experiment and use your criteria and best judgement.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Important: safety is first, specially on the field. Never go alone to remote or unknown places.</strong>

                    <h3>Steps</h3>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Start to setup your equipment in daylight</li>
                            <content>
                                This is, assemble your mount, telescope, focus and test your cameras, computer and software. Please refer to <a href="vhg_fp_deepspace.htm" title="Deep Space process">Deep Space</a> or 
                                <a href="vhg_fp_planetary.htm" title="Planetary Photography">Planetary Photography</a> to read about the specific technique for the types of objects you intend to photograph.<br /><br />
                                
                                <div class="refractorcontainer">
                                    <img src="vhg_fp_refractor.jpg" alt="Refractor Telescope" title="Refractor Telescope and accesories" class="refractor" />
                                    Refractor Telescope with accesories and Computerized mount
                                </div>
                                <br />
                            </content>

                        <li>As soon as is dark enough and you can spot the North Star, start your alignment process</li>
                        
                        <li>When is finally dark, you should not be doing adjustments or installing equipment. This should have been done previously during daylight.</li>
                        
                        <li>Locate the objects you need to photograph using your software or remote from your telescope if you have a computerized telescope and mount.</li>
                            <content>
                                For this hobby it is necessary that your mount have at least motors to be able to follow celestial objects as time passes. There are several affordable options to convert a manual mount to a motorized mount. 
                                manual controlled mounts are not adviceable to be used for astrophography.<br /><br />

                                <div class="reflectorcontainer">
                                    <img src="vhg_fp_reflector.jpg" alt="Reflector Telescope" title="Reflector Telescope and accesories" class="reflector" />
                                    Reflector Telescope setup and manual mount with motors
                                </div>
                                <br />
                            </content>
                        
                        <li>Take your pictures in the way outlined in the <a href="vhg_fp_deepspace.htm" title="Deep Space process">Deep Space</a> or <a href="vhg_fp_planetary.htm" title="Planetary Photography">Planetary Photography</a> sections. </li>
                        
                        <li>Download images to your computer and get ready for post-processing</li>
                            <content>
                                Astrophotography involves post processing. Rarely all the amazing pictures you see from Hubble and any other astronomical website or astronomer are the raw images straight from the camera.
                                Each type of celestial object has its own technique for post processing and these techniques are sometimes complicated that even if not done well, can damage your pictures instead of enhace them.
                                This process is about experimenting and applying good judgement because the technical aspect of it will not solve your problem by itself.
                                <br />

                        <li>When you have finished your post processing, your pictures are ready for whatever use you want to give them!, congratulations, you made it!!!</li>
