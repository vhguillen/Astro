                <p>
                    Deep space photography conists of taking pictures of Stars, Galaxys, Star Clusters and Nebulas, and this type of photography requires patience and a lot of takes per object.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The recommended type of telescope is the Refractor due to the large field of view that provides. <br /> Another important accesory is the Autoguider which will keep the object in a fixed
                    position as the Earth moves in the night.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The type of camera needed is a DSLR like a Nikon or Cannon; or a specialized deep space camera.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This technique requires a long exposure photography and the take of "dark frames", and that's why the Autoguider is needed. The Earth movement makes objects to dissapear or move significantly
                    from the field of view of a telescope in 45 seconds. Using a manual mount with motors will allow to expose the camera only 30 seconds before significan aberration appear on the picture and if you
                    want to take pictures with more than 30 seconds of exposure, you will need a computerized mount and an autoguider in your telescope.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Dark frames are pictures that must be taken following a take to the object, and they are done by covering the telescope lens and taking a picture of the dark. This is, if you take a picture of
                    a star for 1 minute, after that picture you must cover the lens of your telescope and take a picture of 1 minute of that dark image.
                    <br />
                    This doubles the time we have to invest in taking our pictures! and there are objects that are really faint and they might take 3, 4, or 5 minutes, and then, you will have to take the dark frame
                    for the same time and this means that if you take a picture of a faint object for 5 minutes, it will take you 10 if you add the dark frame.
                </p>

                <h3>Steps</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>If you use a DSLR, set the mode to Maunual; ISO to 400 or more; set the time of exposure more than 30 seconds</li>
                    <li>If you use a deep space Camera, in the software of the camera, set the properties as the DSLR described above</li>
                    <li>Focus your object at the best of your ability</li>
                    <li>When ready, shoot! and wait...seriously...</li>
                    <li>Repeat the process. I usually take about 10 or more pictures of the same object (along with the corresponding dark frame)</li>
                    <li>Use your astronomy stacker software of your choice to produce a stacked image from the best frames in your pictures</li>
                        <content>
                            This stacking software will create a file, usually with .TIF extension which consist of the sum of all best images out of your pictures, both the object pictures and dark frames.
                        </content>
                    <li>In Post processing, using your favorite software for photo edition, remove noise; do a white balance; modify brightness/contrast/saturation to your taste</li>
                        <content>
                            <strong>Important:</strong> the file you will use for post-processing, is the resultant .TIF out of the video stacking
                        </content>
