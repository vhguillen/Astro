            <h1>Planetary Photography</h1>

            <div id="innercontent">
                
                <p>
                    Planetary photography is the most dynamic of all because is involved obtaining pictures of the objects closer to Earth, but only 3 of them are easy to photograp: The Sun, the Moon and Jupiter.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The recommended type of telescope is the Reflector.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The rest of the planets are trickier to photograph, because they are smaller and they don't have the brightness or they don't reflect the sun as good as the Moon or Jupiter.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the Sun and the Moon, you don't even need sophisticated equipment, but at the same time your cellphone won't make it either. You need at least a mid-range consumer camera that allows to set it to manual mode.
                    The Sun being a natural source of light, and the Moon having the ability to greatly reflect the light from the Sun, make them perfect candidates to start with. Jupiter even if it reflect the sunlight very well, 
                    we cannot take it with a regular camera, and we need a Telescope.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The rest of the planets due to its size and distance, are a little difficult and we need a Telescope.
                </p>

                <h3>The Moon - camera - no telescope</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>Set the camera to manual mode</li>
                    <li>Set the exposure time to 1/250 - 1/300</li>
                    <li>Set the ISO to 100 for full moon, or up to 400 on waxing or waning moon</li>
                    <li>Download videos to your computer and get ready for post-processing</li>
                    <li>In Post processing, using your favorite software for photo edition, remove noise; do a white balance; modify brightness/contrast/saturation to your taste</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>The Sun - camera - no telescope</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>Must done in the few minutes of dawn OR the minutes before sunset</li>
                    <li>Set the exposure to 1/400 or more</li>
                    <li>Set the ISO to 100</li>
                        <content>
                            <strong>Warning:</strong> using a larger ISO or long exposure will burn your camera sensor
                        </content>
                    <li>In Post processing, using your favorite software for photo edition, remove noise; do a white balance; modify brightness/contrast/saturation to your taste</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>All planets including Sun and Moon - Telescope</h3>

                <p>
                    This technique is made by recording video with a specialized planetary camera, or with a regular webcam that has been adapted to fit in the eyepiece holder of the telescope.
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Set your video software to record at 30 fps</li>
                    <li>Experiment with the resolution: 720 HD, 1080 HD, etc.</li>
                    <li>Make sure your camera has the best focus you can</li>
                    <li>Record the video for about 3 to 5 minutes</li>
                    <li>Repeat the process a couple of times, some video might be good than other</li>
                    <li>Download videos to your computer and get ready for post-processing</li>
                    <li>Use your astronomy stacker software of your choice to produce a stacked image from the best frames in your video</li>
                        <content>
                            This stacking software will create a file, usually with .TIF extension which consist of the sum of all best images out of your video frames.
                        </content>
                    <li>In Post processing, using your favorite software for photo edition, remove noise; do a white balance; modify brightness/contrast/saturation to your taste</li>
                        <content>
                            <strong>Important:</strong> the file you will use for post-processing, is the resultant .TIF out of the video stacking
